            <h4>About</h4>
            When the University of the Cordilleras (then Baguio Colleges) opened its doors on June 19, 1946 to 154 students, the College of Education started with the curriculum of Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) with 25 students and 19 females for Elementary Teachers Certificate (ETC). From this batch, successful superintendents, supervisors and deans who currently lead the provincial and city schools’ offices emerged, not to mention the score of teachers in both private and public schools. In 1958, after 12 years of offering the ETC course, the curriculum of Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED) was created. Following the first decade of service, additional course offerings were implemented, namely: Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED), Bachelor of Science in Industrial Education (BSIE), and Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (BSHE). Baguio Colleges Foundation was granted Government Recognition No. 119, Series of 1950 for a FOUR-YEAR EDUCATION PROGRAM which empowered it to grant a degree of Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Government Recognition No. 280, Series of 1958 for the FOUR-YEAR COLLEGIATE NORMAL COLLEGE which further empowered it to grant the degree Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education (BSEED). On September 7, 2007, the College has been identified by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Teacher Education Council (TEC) as Center of Training Institution (COT) to serve as service provider for DepEd Certificate and other In-Service Training Programs. On November 5, 2010, the College of Teacher Education was awarded by CHED as Center of Excellence for Teacher Education (COE), by virtue of Resolution 257- 2010 approved by the Commission en banc. In 2015, the College of Education, now known as the College of Teacher Education, was awarded Level III Re-Accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association for Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). On August 2, 2018, the College has been awarded Certificate of Recognition for having its curriculum reviewed through the Outcomes-based Pre-service Teacher Education Program: Curriculum Quality Audit, by the Research Center for Teacher Quality (RCTQ), Philippine Normal University (PNU), University of New England (UNE), and SiMERR National Research Center.</p>

            <p><h4>Vision-Mission</h4>
            The College of Teacher Education firmly believes that teachers constitute the most important resource in the nation's teaching-learning force. As such, they should be imbued with the ideals, aspirations and traditions of Philippine life and culture and should be equipped not only with the necessary pedagogical skills but also with adequate and updated knowledge in their field in line with the institution's goal of providing relevant education.The College of Teacher Education of the University of the Cordilleras aims to develop teachers who will be effective agents in the realization of the national educational goals and most importantly those who will be able to transform people into well-rounded individuals capable of eliciting positive change in the society. Specifically, it aims to develop teachers who:

            1. recognize the role education plays as an effective agent of change; thereby, actively contribute to the realization of national goals;

            2. believe in and live the values such as work, thrift, self-discipline, self-reliance, honesty, respect for the right of others, self-respect, cooperation and integrity;

            3. have a working knowledge of and interest in the principles, science and skill in application of these for the improvement of life;

            4. show interest and faith in the teaching profession as a mission for service;

            5. possess the knowledge and basic skills necessary to conduct research work; and apply research finding to help target beneficiaries and initiate improvement;

            6. make teaching and learning relevant by drawing subject matter from the nature, needs and problems of the environment.</p>

            <p><h4>Core Values</h4>
           Based on our Vision and Mission as a College to develop teachers who will become agents in the transformation of people and society, we commit to imbue in ourselves the following CORE Values that exemplify an Effective Educator:

          Service: We commit to actively get involved in endeavors in and out of the school, establishing partnership with other educational institutions and agencies in the community as we strive to improve education and the quality of life for all as our way of giving back to the community what we have obtained from the University.

          Excellence: We strive for excellence in all our academic and non-academic pursuits and hold ourselves committed to the highest standards of honesty, fairness, respect and professionalism as we demonstrate how we value the dignity of people, especially the children entrusted to our care. We further commit to a continuous self-improvement, to become lifelong learners with integrity and pride as we regularly innovate and make relevant our knowledge and competence.

          Empowerment: We embrace all aspects of human diversity, acknowledging the capacities of every individual as we foster their personal and professional growth and inspire them to be worthy leaders and engaged followers through our example.

          Determination: We challenge ourselves to pursue our process of becoming the person that we are destined to be by the Almighty as we brave the problems and difficulties in the complexity of the teaching profession.

          We further pledge to become the SEED that the University sows across the land as we contribute to the formation of the youth and the improvement of society.</p>
